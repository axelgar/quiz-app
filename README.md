# Cint UI Team Take Home Assessment

## Introduction

This is my solution for the Cint UI home assessment test.

## Solution

I tried to implement first a very simple solution to have the essential requirements and then build on top with features I think can be useful for the experience and some refactors along the way. I tried to document my thoughts/ideas in the [ROADMPA.md](./ROADMAP.md) file, also the git history might be useful :)

I decided to go with a simple SPA with not framework (like Next.js) since it is a very simple application. And I decided to use Vite as it is the build tool recommended by the React team.

For the styles I decided to go with Talwind since I am very used to it and it allows me to go quite quick for basic design layouts.

## Possible next steps

- Show difficulty
- Keep track of questions already used and not repeat
